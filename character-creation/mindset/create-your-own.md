# Create your own

A mindset connects function with abilities. To create a balanced mindset you should follow this path:

* **Function.** A mindset should have a function in this world. Often the people sell, heal or defend people. With this function you can create mindsets based on the main mindsets in this rules, however be creative there are many functions.
* **Equipment & Ability.** Based on this function you should now think about: What does the character need to follow it's function? For example: The soldier should defend it's people. To do this he needs a very good weapon. Therefor this mindset have 1 weapon slot more than the other classes and also starts with a level 1 weapon mod.&#x20;
* **Stats.** Ask yourself what a person with your mindset learned in his education. Which skill improvement does this person need? A very simple on is to give a character 2 additional skillpoints in 1 category or 1 SP in 2 categories.
