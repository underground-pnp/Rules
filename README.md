# Introduction

Underground connects the Metro setting with a little bit of steampunk.&#x20;

You can connect any other setting, where you have an underground space with connections.

In this RPG you can’t level a character, however your weapons are getting better with upgrades. As a character you have the possibility to collect materials to craft upgrade stuff. Because many materials are very limited you have to manage them in a frugal way.

In this system you don’t want to join a fight. This is a golden rule, because fights are…

* &#x20;deadly - because weapons easily kill you with two shots, you will die quickly.
* &#x20;wasteful - Ammunition is expensive, because you pay with ammunition to buy food, weapons and more.

However, you need every bullet to fight against monsters.

Because there is no leveling system there is no class system. However you can choose between features that replace classes.&#x20;
