# The Underground

The underground is the last space, where humans can survive. In cities like London, Berlin or Moskau this space is the metro.&#x20;

This has a big advancement for dungeon master: You already got one of the biggest maps a pnp can have. Just download the maps from the internet.&#x20;



In the underground are many groups that differ from city to city. There are bandits, political parties and independent groups. Some of them are friendly, some others are neutral and some of them are your enemies.

These groups capture stations to get control. After all every group tries to survive and defeat the enemies. As an adventurer group you follow quests and may need to spy on an enemy or execute somebody or get some information.&#x20;
