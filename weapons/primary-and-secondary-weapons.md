# Primary and Secondary Weapons

You can carry one primary weapon set and one secondary weapon set. It's named "set" because you can carry two light weapons of the same type at once (as a set).

A light weapon can only have 2 non-magical modifications (for soldiers too!) at the same time, else it loses the light attribute.&#x20;

Another special case is if a weapon is heavy. If your primary weapon is heavy you can't have a secondary weapon, else than a knife. A weapon gets heavy with 3+STR or more non-magical modifications. Where STR is your characters strength and at least 0.
